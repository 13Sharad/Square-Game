# Square-Game

The Square game is an interactive, browser-based implementation of the classic game that allows users to play against either another player or an AI opponent. The game is designed to provide a fun and engaging experience through a responsive and user-friendly interface.

Key Features:

Gameplay Mechanics:

Players take turns placing their marks (either 'X' or 'O') in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with their marks.
AI Opponent:

The game includes an intelligent AI that can play against users, making strategic moves to either win or block the player's attempts at winning. The AI employs basic algorithms to evaluate the game state and make optimal decisions.
Dynamic UI:

The game features a visually appealing interface that dynamically updates based on the players' actions. Each move is reflected instantly, with clear indicators for turns and game outcomes.
Winning Conditions:

The game checks for winning combinations after each turn. When a player wins, a congratulatory message is displayed, and a sound effect enhances the celebratory moment. If all boxes are filled without a winner, a message indicates a tie.
Visual Feedback:

A unique visual effect is employed to draw a winning line across the winning combination of boxes, making it easy for players to see how the victory was achieved.
Reset Functionality:

Players can easily reset the game to start a new round without reloading the page. The reset functionality clears the board and resets the game state, allowing for endless gameplay.
Technologies Used:

The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a smooth and responsive user experience. Event listeners are utilized to handle player interactions, and the game's logic is implemented using JavaScript functions.
